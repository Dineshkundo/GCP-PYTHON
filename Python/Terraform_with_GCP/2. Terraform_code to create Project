provider "google" {
  project = "your-billing-project-id"  # Use the project ID associated with your billing account
  region  = "us-central1"  # Set your desired region
}

resource "google_project" "example_project" {
  name            = "example-project"
  project_id      = "example-project"
  billing_account = "your-billing-account-id"  # Use the ID of your billing account
}

###In this Terraform configuration:

Replace "your-billing-project-id" with the project ID associated with your billing account.
Set "your-billing-account-id" to the ID of your billing account.
Adjust the region in the provider block to your desired region.
Modify the name and project_id in the google_project resource block to your preferred project name and ID.
After defining the Terraform configuration, follow these steps:

Initialize Terraform with terraform init.
Review the planned changes with terraform plan.
If everything looks good, apply the changes with terraform apply.
This setup will create a GCP project associated with your billing account, effectively creating a project without being tied to an organization. Note that this approach may have limitations and implications, so consider the requirements and implications carefully before proceeding.###
